# Hashmap
Data Structures course portfolio project, leverages dynamic arrays and linked lists to implement a hashmap data structure.

Hash_map.py implements a hashmap class. The class can accomodate any arbitrary hash function and it features methods to add, delete, and retreive elements from the table. It's also possible to calculate the load balance and resize the table. To support the class, a module containing both a dynamic array and linked list class is imported (a7_include.py). Hash colisions are resolved via chaining.
